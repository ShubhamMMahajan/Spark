# Spark
Me just messing around using Apache Spark, Python, and Jupyter Notebook to test Spark's capabilities.  

I connected all three of these softwares using this article https://blog.sicara.com/get-started-pyspark-jupyter-guide-tutorial-ae2fe84f594f  

For the graph nodes application, I was trying to find out which nodes should have connections based on the connections the node already has. This kind of application comes in handy when you are trying to figure out a users interest. For example, Facebook will often recommend you friends. There will never be a case where facebook will suggest you friends where you have no mutual friends with that person. Amazon might use this to figure out what their customers want to buy based on the product you bought and other customers who also bought that product. This application can be used in many cases and since I use Spark, I could easily process large amounts of data.
